    <h2> How do we use CICD</h2>
    <p>
        CI/CD falls under DevOps (the joining of development and operations) and combines the practices of continuous 
        integration and continuous delivery. CI/CD automates much or all of the manual human intervention traditionally 
        needed to get new code from a commit into production such as build, test, and deploy, as well as infrastructure 
        provisioning. With a CI/CD pipeline, developers can make changes to code that are then automatically tested and 
        pushed out for delivery and deployment. Get CI/CD right and downtime is minimized and code releases happen faster.
