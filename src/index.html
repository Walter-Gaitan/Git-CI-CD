    <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
    <p>        
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h2> How do we use CICD</h2>
    <p>
        CI/CD falls under DevOps (the joining of development and operations) and combines the practices of continuous 
        integration and continuous delivery. CI/CD automates much or all of the manual human intervention traditionally 
        needed to get new code from a commit into production such as build, test, and deploy, as well as infrastructure 
        provisioning. With a CI/CD pipeline, developers can make changes to code that are then automatically tested and 
        pushed out for delivery and deployment. Get CI/CD right and downtime is minimized and code releases happen faster.
